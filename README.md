## Source-Code in TensorFlow using MNIST Classification Dataset 
1. [ShallowNet](https://github.com/maponti/deeplearning-sibgrapi17/blob/master/mnist_shallownet.py): shallow network with input and output layers
2. [DeepNet](https://github.com/maponti/deeplearning-sibgrapi17/blob/master/mnist_deepnet.py): deep network with two hidden dense (fully connected) layers
3. [DeepConvNet](https://github.com/maponti/deeplearning-sibgrapi17/blob/master/mnist_deepconvnet.py): deep network with two hidden layers, one convolutional, one fully connected)
